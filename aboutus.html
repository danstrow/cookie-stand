          <p>Check it out! Pat and his family are eating delicious <br>
          cookies. Those are TOTALLY not chocolate chip. They are real <br>
        chunks of salmon. Delicious! <br>
      Pat was born in the Puget Sound (literally) to a family of Killer Whales. <br>
    He was house trained by humans at the age of 12.</p>
